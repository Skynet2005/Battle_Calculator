# Introduction - What Are Heroes?

Heroes are remarkable individuals who have thrived in the face of the global temperature crisis. They have striven for excellence in their respective fields, providing them with unique abilities and ways they can help your City or troops. Their renown and expertise allows them to lead military units into battle, and their skills and battle experience can inspire and benefit different troop types.

You encounter your first Hero at Furnace Level 4, when a mysterious stranger saves one of your survivors from an unfortunate encounter with some local wildlife. The stranger reveals his name is Bahiti, that he is a skilled Explorer and agrees to stay and help your City.

After building a (rather ostentatious) Hero Hall building for Bahiti (c’mon, the guy lives in a wagon with a Mammoth, he doesn't want a Hall…) he tells you he has friends who are adept in Combat that may be willing to help as well if you can recruit them to your cause. And so, your Hero roster begins to grow!

# Hero Types
## Combat Type
In the world of Whiteout Survival there are three types of troop that can be trained; Infantry, Lancers and Marksman. Heroes follow the same pattern with their types, and provide buffs and skill abilities that can help one or more of the types of troops fighting with them.

In Expedition Battles, Infantry are in the front row; they take the brunt of the enemy attack and act as the game’s tanks. They are characterized by high health and defense, but lower attack and lethality stats. Behind them are the Lancers, the game’s great all-rounders. And at the back are the Marksman, who have the highest single-target DPS and are characterized by high attack and lethality, but low defense and health.

You have more control over the positioning of Heroes and their escort troops in Exploration/Arena battles, but the role outlines of the three types are the same. Furthermore, each type has defensive bonuses and advantages against one other type - in a ‘Rock-Paper-Scissors’ kind of combat triangle.

This is useful to remember as you develop in the game and enter into combat scenarios.

## Expedition Skill Type
Currently there are two Expedition Skill types; Combat and Growth. The type denotes what kind of focus the Hero’s Expedition skills are intended to have. Now, a Growth Hero doesn’t mean they won’t be good at combat as well, it just means that they have Expedition skills which benefit the Growth of your City. For example, Zinman is a Growth Marksman who has 2 of his 3 Expedition skills dedicated to making building construction in your City cheaper / quicker. His third skill (and his two Weapon skills) are combat skills, but he is designated as a Growth Hero overall.

# Hero Rarity
You’ll notice in the Hero menu that Heroes have different colors - this is to help denote the Heroes’ rarity. Currently, there are three rarity types:
- “R” - Rare Heroes, who have a blue Hero card
- “SR” - Epic Heroes, who have a purple Hero card
- “SSR” - Mythic Heroes, who have a gold Hero card

The rarer the Hero, the better stats and abilities they have, but the harder they are to collect. For example, every Hero has skills unique to them; Rare Heroes get 4 skills, Epic Heroes get 5, and Mythic Heroes get 6 skills and an Exclusive Weapon gear item which has an extra 2 skills.

You may also hear people talking about “Generations” of Heroes. This refers to sets of Mythic Heroes which are released in batches as the State ages.

## Exploration
For Exploration, you’ll see three stats listed; Attack, Defense and Health. These are outlined for the Hero themselves, and the ‘Escorts’ they have (Escorts are the troops of the same type grouped around the Hero during Exploration combat). The number of escorts increases with the Hero level.
If you read the description of some Heroes’ Exploration skills, you’ll note that damage and healing are based on the Hero’s Attack stat (the skill description will state `Attack * x%`). In Exploration fights, your damage attempts to break through the enemy Defense and reduce their Health down to 0 (for both the Hero and any Escorts with them).
Exploration stats can be increased by:
- Increasing the Hero’s level
- Increasing the Hero’s Star Level
- Adding or upgrading Hero Gear
- Adding or upgrading a Hero’s Exclusive Weapon (if they have one)

## Expedition
For Expedition, the stats that are utilized are slightly different; Expedition combat relies on Attack, Defense, Lethality and Health. In these fights, the Attack is used to lower enemy defense, and Lethality is used to deal damage to enemy Health. Expedition stats are a percentage, rather than a flat number, and the percentage is added to any other combat stat bonuses you have at the time of battle (such as City buffs, Chief Gear/Charms, Pet skills, War research, etc.) The percentage is only applied on troops of the same type (so Bahiti from our earlier example boosts Marksman troops as the menu states).  This is true unless the skill specifically states that it applies directly to the troops.
For the stats listed in the Hero Stat Overview menu, you can increase:
- Attack / Defense through Star Level ascension
- Lethality / Health through adding or upgrading Hero Gear or a Hero’s Exclusive Weapon (if they have one).

## Hero Skills and Stats
The Hero Skills are details all of the skills. There are two types of skills:
- Exploration - used in Arena and Exploration fights (or any time you can select a 5-Hero lineup).
- Expedition - used in Intel Missions, Wilderness map fights, Alliance Championship, combat events and PVP (or any time you can select a 3-Hero lineup).
Every Hero starts with 1 Exploration and 1 Expedition skill unlocked at first, and these skills will be level 1. There is a maximum of 6 skill slots a Hero can have, and each skill can be upgraded to level 5 maximum.

The distinction between these two types is important considering how the skills are being applied during your particular type of combat.

## Hero Gear
The Hero Gear is customizable gear your Hero can wear. Hero Gear buffs the stats of a Hero, and can be upgraded in multiple ways. Each Hero has at least 4 gear slots:
- Goggles
- Gloves
- Belt
- Boots
(We'll implement Hero Gear After we get the foundation of the Skills including Exclusive skills, if applicable, from Hero Widget levels taken care of)
