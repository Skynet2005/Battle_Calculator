Battle Report Breakdown

**Each Expedition Battle or Rally will produce a Battle Report**

For the purposes of this guide I've split up the sections, but here is the original image in all it's lengthy glory.
The guide will contain some additional contextual information.

The Battle Overview Section,
The Battle Overview section is the first thing you'll see when you open war-mail. It contains all of the key information at a high-level to help you identify (at the time) the results of battle and total troop injuries, deaths and survivors...
Or if you've saved the mail and are reviewing later, this section has useful information to help remember which battle this was, who the teams were, when and where the battle was held, etc.

Layout,
At the top of the section are the details of the date/time of battle, the battle location, the location of each leader (if the report is of a City battle, one of the locations will be the same as the battle location).

Then we have our two Battle Leaders, this could be solo or as part of a rally/garrison, and the Battle result.

Finally, we have the total Troop details, including:
Power Lost for each team,
Total Troop Count,
Troop Losses (deaths),
Severe Injuries (Injured),
Light Injuries (Lightly Injured),
Surviving troops,

You'll have seen in game already that your Alliance territory, ally marches, etc. are all in 'Blue'. This is a theme that's continued in the Battle Report, as the left-side of the report will always be for your team (in blue).
The Enemy you're fighting is on the right side and (the same as in-game) in red.

Because of this, the game uses "Attacker" and "Defender" symbols to show who initiated the fight, and who was defending from the attack.

Bonus Source Information,
Next up we have the Bonus Sources for the fight outlined. A 'Bonus Source' is the source of the Heroes, skills and stats that will be applied when handling the battle calculations.

For solo attacks, the Leader and the Bonus Source will be the same person,
For Rallies, the Rally Leader (one who calls the rally) will be the Bonus Source as well,
For Garrison, the Garrison Leader (person at the top of the Garrison list denoted by a flag) and the Bonus Source can be different people. This is because the Bonus Source for Garrison (and reinforced cities) is determined by the member with the highest total combat power from Chief Gear / Charms, Hero Gear, Hero Power, and Battle Research.,

In our battle we can see that Team Drink (the attackers) have Purple Coffee as their Rally Leader and Bonus Source, but Team Food has Green Coffee as the Garrison Leader, and Green Donut as the Bonus Source.

Chief Gear and Heroes,
The Chief Gear, Charms and Hero Skills that are used in the fighting come from the Bonus Source. Other members in the defense garrison may have better Chief Gear, or Hero stats, but it is the person with the highest overall combat power that is selected.

This is useful to remember as you can 'hide' strong Alliance members within a garrison, and have a weaker member take the Leader position to entice attacks. For the unsuspecting enemies who fail to scout (or read their scout reports properly) this can prove to be a nasty surprise when they strike!

This may have been Team Food's strategy, or perhaps Green Cheese had larger rally capacity, which could be a potential tactic for mid-spending Alliances (although not one I've seen commonly); to split the focus of key rally members between some people going for capacity buffs, and others focusing Chief / Hero stats.

Troops and Stats Section,
This section and the Bonus Source information are the two most screen-shotted elements of Battle Reports. Mostly, this is for "HUGE WHALE SIGHTINGS" that people want to share their incredulity of high stats and/or Chief gear üòÇ
But in my opinion, it's the most useful section of the whole report.

Troop Power Comparison,
This area has multiple ways to visualise the troops involved in the battle. There are the three red/blue gauges at the top, average Tier and FC level of all deployed troops, and most recently, a toggle in the top-right between raw troop count and percentage weightings of troops.

This is extremely handy when you want to verify a) the effectiveness of different troop formation strategies, and b) whether your intended troop formation strategy actually translated into the troop count. When you're holding garrison over multiple attacks (like Team Food and Team Drink are battling it out for Sunfire Castle) there are constant attacks and losses happening. When people top-up their garrisoned troops, it's not always in the intended formation the rally leads call for. This section of the report can show whether the strategy has drifted from reality.

As the name suggests, the Red/Blue gauges show the distribution of power between the two team's troop types (thanks to @Dakanoth for confirming this!) However it should be noted that just because a troop has more power, doesn't always mean that it has better raw stats. So the meters need to be read with context of the troop count details below it.

For example:
The other image I've attached here shows a no-Heroes 1v1 between an FC5 T5 Infantry troop and a Non-FC T7 troop. The raw stats of these troops are:

         Att  Def  Leth  HP
FC5 T5    9   13    8    15
FC0 T7    7   10    7    12

The FC5 has better stats across the board, but the image visually shows a roughly 60-40 split in favour of the T7. This is because the power value of the FC5 T5 is 18 and the FC0 T7 is 28, and (28 / (18+28))*100 gives us 60.87% - this is what the gauge is showing.


Both the raw troop numbers and the percentages are really useful when understanding why a formation did or did not work, and planning a counter-attack. We can see that Team Food has a high number of Infantry troops, which is common for a defending team so that the Infantry (who are on the front line) can take the brunt of the enemy damage to protect the Lancers/Marksman damage dealers behind them. It is worth noting here (and we'll go into this in more detail later in the guide) that Team Food has:
More raw troop count in every category,
Higher average Troop Tier level (1-2 people in Team Food must have T11 Infantry judging by the 10.2 average Tier number),
Higher average Troop FC level overall (FC3 vs FC4 marksman just tipping it),

And yet we know from the Overview section that Team Drink wins this fight... Intriguing! üßê

Stat Bonuses,
The Stat Bonuses listed in the report come from the stats, gear and Heroes of the Bonus Source. They are the ones that are applied to the damage calculations for the fight, and include any additional buffs that are added to the fight, such as:
City Buffs,
Exclusive Weapon bonuses,
Pet buffs,
Territory Defense buffs,
Note: For Solo attacks, weapon widgets will be disabled. And if you and the enemy have the same 20% buffs, they cancel each other out.

The one thing that's not included in the report is stats given by Joiner skills. But we hope for the future!

Also remember with Battle Reports you can ‚≠ê the mail to save it and review later.

Battle Details - Skill Triggers,
Whenever I see someone posting a Battle Report questioning how the result could have happened, the explanation is usually in one of two places:
1Ô∏è‚É£ - The Troop Formations,
2Ô∏è‚É£ - The Skill Triggers,

When something has a 'chance' of happening, it is handled by generating a random number with upper and lower bounds, and the result will determine what happen; it's literally rolling the cyber dice, and people refer to "RNG" (random number generation) as a blessing and a curse as it's the gamble of statistical outcomes.
I have seen battles overturned purely on skill 'procs' (programmed random occurrences - the RNG I mentioned above).

Layout,
This section pits the Heroes of the Bonus Source against one another as the battle progresses. Expedition combat is carried out over a number of 'turns', and the outcome of the battle (in terms of skills) is presented here.
It does not matter what order the Heroes are deployed in, this section will always evaluate Infantry Hero vs Infantry Hero, Lancer Hero vs Lancer Hero, etc.

The skill is displayed alongside the number of times it triggered during the battle, and (where it is a skill that results in damage to the enemy) the number of enemy kills it provided. For passive skills (or those which provide bonuses permanently active during the fight) they will show on the report with a single trigger.

Turn Estimation,
" - Report Weirdness Alert! -

Skill triggers are a hotly debated topic in the community. As the Battle Report does not confirm how many turns occurred during the battle, or WHERE in the fight they can occur, we are left trying to estimate the number of turns based on the skill procs. Where these are reliant on RNG, this gets far more difficult.

Full disclosure that until we get confirmation either from the devs, or in the report itself of the number of turns, we're all just trying to make sense of the (often confusing) numbers we see on the report as best as we can from the skill text. I do not have the magic formula to explain skill procs yet, but if you're interested, join the discussion and help us reverse engineer it!"


For example, in the 1v1 Infantry fight I mentioned earlier (between a single FC5 T5 Infantry troop and a non-FC T7 troop) there were no heroes present to count skill procs. However, FC5 Infantry have a 37.5% chance of offsetting damage. Looking at the numbers, this fight should have lasted no more than 1, or perhaps 2 turns at the max.
    ...and yet my FC skill procced 10 times. :worry_shrug:

In the guide section image I have attempted to explain the way I approach turn estimation, however the important thing to take from this section is how the skill triggers affected the battle.

For Team Food, a lot of their procs were centred around damage reduction (which can help extend the battle - the longer your troops live, the more proc chances!). The offensive procs from Mia and the FC5 lancers got a respectable amount of kills, but Team Drink really shone with their FC5 Marksman procs, getting nearly 4x the kills from 2.5x the procs of Team Food.
It is not surprising from this that between the Lancer and Marksman offence in the rally, that Team Food's Infantry would be decimated.

Battle Details - Team Composition / Personal Outcomes,
Making Sense of the Numbers,
First things first, troop losses are an issue that should be addressed quickly. This isn't particularly controversial - the more you can mitigate troop deaths, the longer your team can keep fighting. In this section we can take the Overview report of 45k losses and see that this is actually one person, Green Ice Cream. For Team Food they might want to exclude this person from future attacks until they have cleared some room in their infirmary, and for Team Drink this could be a sign of wearing down the enemy defense by filling their hospitals faster than they can heal them.

And on that point, severely injured troops are the ones that end up in the Infirmary (375k and 268k respectively). This can and should be factored into the decisions regarding your next attack. If Team Food have losses, are there more members with hospitals that are full, or nearly full? Do your team need a break to heal before you fight again, or can your Alliance group together to get through the healing in small batches?

Then there's the surviving troops; for Team Food this section allows them to check what troops are left in the garrison after the fight. In this case, the surviving troops are 64% Lancers and 36% Marksman - no infantry. This could potentially open an avenue for Team Food to plan a counter-attack using march speedups to get ahead of incoming reinforcements and retake the castle.
For Team Drink, the garrison window will show troop formation easier than the report will, but the low number of survivors alone should be prompting them to get reinforcements in quickly.

Rally Joiner Skills,
There are numerous guides ahead of me that explain the concept of Rally Joiner skill selection better than I can in this word count, but the main thing to note is that:
For Rallies, the first 4 joiners with the highest 1st Expedition skill will be selected,
For Garrison, the first 4 members after the Garrison Leader with the highest 1st Expedition skill will be selected,

Unlike Rallies, R4s/R5s can change the Leader of the Garrison once inside. This, and the fact the Bonus Source does not need to be the Garrison Leader, can be very useful for organising tactical defenses:
Consider a member who uses speedups to capture a building first, they can then switch Leader to someone else when they arrive,
Or a strong player can 'hide' within the garrison of a building whilst someone else leads, and surprise those who failed to scout (or read their scout reports properly!),
Or you can split the responsibilities in an Alliance to have one person with strong combat stats, and another player focusing on Rally Capacity who can take the Garrison Lead to let more troops in,

For the purposes of this guide, I've illustrated the 1st Hero selections of all members in the battle. Rally joiners are easy, it's the first four listed after the leader (3x Jessie and 1x Patrick), but for the Garrison team, it's the first four after the Leader. Which means Green Cheese Ahmose isn't counted, and instead Team Food has 3x Jessie and 1x Jeronimo as their joining heroes.

Whether Team Food was "hiding the whale" here or utilising Green Cheese for extra garrison capacity, the fact that Green Donut is at the bottom of the list is interesting. When you switch a Garrison Leader, the previous leader goes to the bottom of the list. Given Team Food's joiner selection, this starts to tell a story that perhaps this team was caught straight after taking the castle. Maybe they did not have enough time to switch to a better garrison lineup before Team Drink's attack hit?

Reports Aren't Just For R4s!,
For team members, you can be proactive here by familiarising yourself with Battle Reports and getting used to reading them. In the middle of chaotic events like Sunfire or State of Power, things can easily get missed. Insightful analysis of battle reports can help give your Alliance what it needs, and if you can do that without needing to wait for your R4s to formulate and communicate a change in strategy, then all the better!

So between the Overview and the Team Composition sections, have a look at the results:
Were there losses on your side?,
Can you spot the person with the full hospital and shout it out in case your leaders miss it in the heat of battle?,
Were there a low number of survivors after the battle (whether you win or lose).,
Could a sped-up solo march be the difference between re-taking the castle, or getting much-needed relief troops in if you held the battle with few survivors?,
Check your formation, your troop count, etc.,
How many troops did you have at the time? Did your formation roughly match your Alliance strategy?,
If not, was that because the garrison was full, or was a re-stock march a little too far away?,
Or in the garrison window itself prior to an attack, check your formations,
If your formation has deviated from the Alliance strategy, then consider sending a few small marches with 10-20k troops of the type you're low on, in order to top up as Turrets or other enemies whittle away at your garrison troops.
